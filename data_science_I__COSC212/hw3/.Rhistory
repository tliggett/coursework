# Some of the factors could be treated numerically:
#   *term is a factor with only 3 levels: 36 months, 60 months, and blank
#   *int_rate is a factor of percentages; these percentages could be looked at as numeric (num) values
#   *revol_util is also a factor of percentages
#   *emp_length is is a factor of year numbers. Could be refactored and measured numerically
#   *earliest_cr_line is a factor of dates, could possibly be formatted as true dates
#       (I don't know if we've talked about dates but I know R can handle them)
# Modifying int_rate to create numeric and then reobserving
