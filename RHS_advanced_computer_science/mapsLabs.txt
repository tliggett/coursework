Maps Labs

I have done maps labs in java and javascript, and here is what I have learned:

In Java, Maps are divided into TreeMaps and HashMaps. TreeMaps sort the objects, HashMaps don't. Processing already has HashMaps
in its ide, so no imports are necessary for this structure. However, if one wants to use a TreeMap they must import java.util, which
will compromise their project and it can no longer be put online.

In JavaScript, one has to develop their own data structures. But the array inside of JavaScript (at least in p5) is not like an array or
arraylist as previously thought, but rather just like a map. 

myArray = [];
myArray[1] = "taco";
myArray["taco"] = 1;

Since all variables are var, they can be used as either the key or value in the array. This means that a javascrip array has the
flexibility to become anything! By making a function, you can create classes with these arrays. The most popular form for a map-like
structure is a Dictionary, which I have used in my labs. But a Dictionary isn't really anything, as you can just change it to be
whatever you want it to be.

Regular Maps Labs:

#1 StrawberrySlayerAlpha
#2 Histogram (Java)
#3 maps3
#4 maps4

Challenge Maps Labs

#1 Dictionary1 - you can find the code for this inside my histogram repository: https://github.com/tliggett/histogram
#2 Histogram (JS) - also at https://github.com/tliggett/histogram, but a live demo at https://tliggett.github.io/histogram
#3 Quotes - found at https://github.com/tliggett/quotes, but a live demo at https://tliggett.github.io/quotes

Happy Labbing
