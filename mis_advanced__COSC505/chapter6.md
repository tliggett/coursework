# Chapter 6

Strategy => Architecture => Infrastructure
(the blueprint)

**Infrastructure**
- hardware
- software
- data
- network
For infrastructure... what type of (hardware, software, etc.) technology are we trying to implement, and what type will benefit us most? And who needs what? Where?
What? Who? Where?

Centralized vs. Decentralized (client/server)
Server can supply software/data or both (Server is serving)
Advantage of centralized blueprint:
- erp (enterprise research planning)


Cloud:
- elastic
- pooled
- internet protocols

Internet as a service (hardware)
Platform as a service (adds the operating system)
Software as a service (adds the software)

Risks of going to cloud:
- dependency on third party (amazon, google)
- reliability
- privacy
- security
- legal (can you let your data be on foreign soil?)

BYOD (Bring your own device into the workspace)
- Issue with security, you have to secure each and every endpoint.
- capacity?
- compatability?
- if you do this, you better have a policy.
- packet sniffing
